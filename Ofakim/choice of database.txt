The storage method that I chose needed to be light and fast  so I chose a file for saving the data and also:
1.amount of data was very small 
2.there is no complex queries 
3.no need of managing a complex queue (multithreaded) which I solve with a lock
4.update the data is simple and not structed.
5.no constraint.
